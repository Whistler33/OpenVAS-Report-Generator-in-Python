# OpenVAS Report Generation Bot

This project provides a Python script to automate the generation of reports from OpenVAS scans using the OpenVAS API. It interacts with the OpenVAS server to initiate scans, retrieve scan results, and generate reports in various formats.

## Features

- Launch OpenVAS scans and retrieve scan results.
- Generate reports in different formats supported by OpenVAS.
- Automate the process of report generation from the command line.

## Prerequisites

- OpenVAS server is installed and configured.
- Python 3.x is installed.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/openvas-report-bot.git

   Install the required packages:
   pip install requests

   Configure
   Modify the script openvas_report_bot.py with your OpenVAS server details and credentials:

API_URL = "https://your-openvas-server:9392"
API_USERNAME = "your-username"
API_PASSWORD = "your-password"

Usage
Launch a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the script to generate a report:
python openvas_report_bot.py


The script uses the OpenVAS API to interact with the OpenVAS server. Ensure that the API URL and credentials are accurate.
